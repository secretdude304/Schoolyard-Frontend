Schoolyard is a place where students can safely and securely communicate with the rest of their school. We strive to facilitate genuine connections between students at schools, something which is hard to do on social networks such as instagram, where it could be anyone on the other side of the screen. We also don't have push notifications, and followers things which have been proven to be harmful to teens mental health.
